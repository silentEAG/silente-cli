# SilentE's Tools v0.0.1
## Introduction
Although this is only a tiny project for python learning, it can make my article department easier. I'm trying to learn from such a tiny project.

## Current Features
Change format for md-files. such as `![]` => `!{}`, `local img url` => `internet img url`, using `--inverse/-i`  to reverse it.

## How to use
### requirements
```text
click==8.0.3
PyYAML==5.4.1
```
### config
just set your img url in `config/main.yml`. For example, set internet img url like `https://file.example.com/img/`, and local img url like `/PIC/`.
